This is another nuisance tool.  It will choose 1 of 10 alarms to play, play the sound, and wait any time between 1-3 minutes.  Then it will repeat.

This tool needs to be downloaded on the target Ubuntu machine and ran once.  Like the other tools, it does not have persistence, and is not intentionally hidden.
