This tool will pop up a gif on the screen that cannot be closed using the typical (x) button.  It is simply an annoyance for the blue team.

In order to run this tool, it simply needs to be downloaded onto the target Ubuntu machine and the executable needs to be ran.

NOTE:
1) There is no persistence built into this executable.  So, if the blue team manages to turn this off, then it will be off for good.
   (This can easily be fixed with a separate persistence program.)
2) This does not try to hide itself, and is called "1984" within the System Manager
